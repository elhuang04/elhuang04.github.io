### About Me
Hi, I'm Elizabeth! I'm an aspiring AI/ML Engineer with a B.A. in Computer Science from Wellesley College. I'm particularly passionate about projects involving vision capabilities and image processing in applications I can visually see the impact I'm able to create.

My interest in computer science was sparked through my hobby of digital art and graphic design. I loved playing around with blend modes, filter effects, bezier curves, anti-aliasing, and rasterization, which drew me to image processing and how software can transform visual data.
