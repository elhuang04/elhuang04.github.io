I'm an aspiring AI/ML Engineer based in Boston, MA, with a background in Computer Science from Wellesley College. I'm particularly passionate about projects involving vision capabilities and image processing in applications I can visually see the impact I'm able to create.

Having experimented a lot with graphic design and digital art in high school, I loved playing around with different blend modes, filter effects, bezier curves, anti-aliasing and rasterization. It sparked my interest for image processing and wanting to learn more about how the software can transform visual data. 

In my free time, I like going to hackathons, working on start-ups, doodling, and playing tennis.
